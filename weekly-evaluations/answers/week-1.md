## what is a branch in github?
### answer:
A branch is a parallel version of a repository (ie; it literally branches out or away from the main repository, kind of like a temporary sub-folder).

It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

## what is a merge?
### answer:
Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

A merge can be done automatically via a Pull Request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.
