## what does call apply and bind do?
### answer:
You can use call()/apply() to invoke the function immediately. bind() returns a bound function that, when executed later, will have the correct context ("this") for calling the original function. So bind() can be used when the function needs to be called later in certain events when it's useful.

## what is a class?
### answer:
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 classalike semantics.
